                This site contains a collection of useful guides and information on various
                topics related to cloud and cloud-native development practices.  They are mostly
                focused on Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Cloud, although there are relevant sections
                for OpenShift on premises and on other clouds.

                kept current using a best-effort approach, and is provided As-Is.
