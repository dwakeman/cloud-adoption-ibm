# Overview

This page will contain instructions for creating a location in IBM Cloud VPC (Gen2).





_**Note:** in cases where cloud-init can be used when creating a virtual server instance you will want to wait to create hosts until **after** you create the location.  To attach a host to a location you need to run a script that you generate when you create the location.  You can run that script using cloud-init, or you can wait until after the host starts up to do it._
